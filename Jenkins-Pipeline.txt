Jenkins Pipeline Process- Documentation
______________
Delivery Pipeline 

1: Chain required jobs in sequence
	-add upstream/downstream jobs

2: Create 3 new jobs
	2.1 SampleBuildJob
	2.2 Sample Deploy Job
	2.3 SampleTestJob
3:  Build the jobs individually and check the console output. 
	-After that , need to trigger the job

4:  To show the demo of the jobs builds, need to open three jobs in 3 different windows
       - Add upstream /downstream jobs
5: First configure SampleDeployJob,
	Under the Build Triggers-> check/select Build after other projects are builld
	  projects to watch = Samplebuildjob

	
6: Like the above go to SampleTestJob
	Under the Build Triggers-> check/select Build after other projects are builld
	  projects to watch = SampleDeployJob

7: Now run the Samplebuildjob,once it is successfully builds check the 
	other window "sampledeployjob", it automatically builds once "samplebuildjob" completed
	same way "Sampletestjob" also builds once "sampledeployjob" completed.

	- give the view name in the box " TestDeliveryPipelineView"
 Under Pipelines  ->Components
	- Add components by giving intial job "samplebuildjob"
	- once we apply, it displays the view of the pipeline
	- if we are not build any jobs then this view will show empty values
	- EditView->
		-Number of pipeline instances per pipeline =3
		- if select "Enable start of new pipeline build", then in pipeline view, "Buildjob" button is visible.(Save and check now)
		- if select "Enable rebuild" then on every job, there is refresh button is visible, 
		   so we  can rebuild the job if requires.(Save and check now)
		- select 
			"Show commit messages"
			"Show total build time"
		select the theme "contrast"
		

Step 4 Run and Validate

how to setup build pipelines in jenkins?

BUILD PIPELINE in Jenkins 

1. As we have already created the following jobs
	-SampleBuildJob
	-SampleDeployJob
	-SampleTestJob
	- These jobs are chained already

2. Now, Install the "BuildPipeline Plugin" in jenkins
     Manage Jenkins-> Manage Plugins->Available section-> search "Build Pipeline" , install and restart jenkins

3. Now, Adding the Build Pipeline View and configure 
	- Go to Dashboard and click on "+"
	-  name="BuildPipelineTestView"
     EditView/Configure
	- Display Options<give any number>=3
     	(with this you can able to view the last 3 builds of jenkins job)
	- to view the console output in new window
	Console Output Link Style= "New Window"
